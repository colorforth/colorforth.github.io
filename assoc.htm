Charley taught himself to program in Forth in the early eighties, just to satisfy his curiosity about computers. Eventually he took classes in more conventional languages, but Forth was and remains his entry point into computing. It made sense to him, and through Forth computers made sense. He has worked as a professional Forth programmer since 1989, implementing a variety of target assemblers and compilers for microcontrollers. More recently he has become obsessed with colorforth.
