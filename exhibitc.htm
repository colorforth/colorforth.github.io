<br>(Project)</h1><h3><ol>

<li>Explore CIP and related opportunities to expand scope of Licensed Technology

<p><li>Pursue licensing discussions with identified prospects

<p><li>Pursue arrangements which can provide financial support for Project activities

<p><li>Implement the following SER Project:
 <p>The Software Emulated Receiver (SER) Project will be initially organized and operated as a TPL Project under a standard TPL Commercialization Agreement (ComAg) between Moore (CHM), Snively (LOS) and TPL pursuant to which:<ol>

<p><li>TPL will pursue the development and commercialization of the SER Technology by establishing a series of strategic relationships which will fund the development of SER Technology by CHM and LOS, as well as the prodectization and marketing of SER based products

<p><li>TPL will operate under exclusive licenses from CHM and LOS covering all SER Technology and Intellectual Property Assets

<p><li>Commercialization Partners will operate under agreements and licenses negotiated and structured by TPL for the commercialization of the SER IPA Potfolio

<p><li>TPL will provide the commercialization, transactional and administrative resources for the SER Project, and CHM and LOS will provide the development resources

<p><li>Everyone will work on a time and materials basis at their standard rates

<p><li>Project proceeds will be used first for the payment of all project expenses, and next for the accumulation of a working capital fund

<p><li>Seventy Percent (70%) of the balance will be distributed equally to CHM and LOS, with 35% going to each

<p><li>The remaining Thirty Percent (30%) will be retained by TPL as its percentage interest, which will be secured by an assignmnet of such percentage interest from CHM and LOS

<p><li>Decisions relating to technical issues (Technical Decisions) shall be the province of LOS and CHM, with any difference of opinion being resolved by TPL. Decisions relating to commercialization issues (Commercialization Decisions) shall be the province of TPL so long as they are within the Commercialization Guideline: IE, that all development projects must be self-funding. Commercialization Decisions not within the said Guideline shall require the concurrence of either LOS or CHM</ol>

<p>As soon as is reasonably practicable, CHM and LOS will organize an entity to hold the legal title to all SER Project Intellectual Property Assets to assure their on-going availability to the Project. TPL shall serve as a "tie breaker" to resolve any deadlock which may arise in any such structure or structures.</ol>
