<h1>MENDING WALL
<br>Robert Frost</h1>

<h3><br clear="left">
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
<br>That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
<br>And spills the upper boulders in the sun,
<br>And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

<p>The work of hunters is another thing:
<br>I have come after them and made repair
<br>Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
<br>But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
<br>To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
<br>No one has seen them made or heard them made,

<p>But at spring mending-time we find them there.
<br>I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
<br>And on a day we meet to walk the line
<br>And set the wall between us once again.
<br>We keep the wall between us as we go.
<br>To each the boulders that have fallen to each.

<p>And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
<br>We have to use a spell to make them balance:
<br>'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'
<br>We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
<br>Oh, just another kind of out-door game,
<br>One on a side. It comes to little more.

<p>There where it is we do not need the wall:
<br>He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
<br>My apple trees will never get across
<br>And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
<br>He only says, 'Good fences make good neighbors'.
<br>Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
<br>If I could put a notion in his head:
<br>'Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it
<br>Where there are cows?'
<br>But here there are no cows.

<p><em>Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
<br>What I was walling in or walling out,</em>
<br>And to whom I was like to give offence.
<br>Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
<br>That wants it down.' I could say 'Elves' to him,
<br>But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
<br>He said it for himself. I see him there
<br>Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
<br>In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.

<p>He moves in darkness as it seems to me -
<br>Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
<br>He will not go behind his father's saying,
<br>And he likes having thought of it so well
<br>He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."
