Comments about life, colorForth and GreenArrays

<p>You're welcome to email me your comments. I like to hear from people, and appreciate your suggestions. But there are several problems:<ul>
<li>Such email usually arrives in my junk mail folder. I try to retrieve them, but a distinguishing subject line would help.
<li>I won't respond to these emails, except on future postings. 'Cause I don't know who you are, and the the web is full of predators.</ul>

<h1><a href="cf.htm">colorForth</a></h1>
A dialect of Forth that uses color to replace punctuation. Native Pentium and Windows versions. Produces extremely compact programs. Instant compile from pre-parsed source.

<p>Latest changes are compressed source: colorForth, OKAD and GA4 in 290K (25%). Also blue words that are executed at edit time, for formatting text.

<h1><a href="vlsi.html">OKAD</a></h1>
A suite of VLSI design tools for layout and simulation. Compact description of gates, cells and chip. Resulting GDS II file ready for fabrication.

<h1> <a href="S40.htm">S40 Multicomputer Chip</a></h1>
<p>Spectacular chip! 40 microcomputers, each with 128 words of 18-bit memory. Each capable of 700 Mips.

I'm pleased to announce the formation of this company. We plan to develop and exploit the concept of multi-computer chips. That gives me another point of contact: <a href="mailto:chuck@greenarraychips.com">chuck@greenarraychips.com</a>.
