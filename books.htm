<h1>Books</h1><h3>
This will be a work in progress. It seems to be addictive. I have to quit and check my bookshelf.

<p>I am what you call an avid reader. Books, magazines, even Sony's eBook. I should quantify that: maybe 100 books/year?

<p>I'm getting pickier as I get older. Or else authors are not as good or style has changed. But it's hard to find a good book.

<p>I have favorite authors. Somehow I've learned to appreciate their different styles:<ul>
<li>Nevil Shute
<br>He has a wonderfully gentle style. Always makes me cry
<li>Tom Clancy
<br>A true professional storyteller
<li>John D MacDonald
<br>Travis McGee is my hero
<li>Robert B Parker
<br>Spenser is my hero
<li>David Weber
<br>Honor Harrington is my hero
<li>Robert A Heinlein
<li>Isaac Asimov
<li>Arthur C Clark
<br>The triumvirate
<li>Ayn Rand
<br>The only philosopher I can read
</ul>

<p>I see no point in documenting these with Publisher, ISBN. If you're interested, Google. Amazon has precis.
