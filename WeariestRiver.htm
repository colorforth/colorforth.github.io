<h1>The Weariest River
<br>Algernon Charles Swinburne</h1>

From too much love of living,
<br>From hope and fear set free,
<br>We thank with brief thanksgiving
<br>Whatever gods may be
<br>That no man lives forever,
<br>That dead men rise up never;
<br><em>That even the weariest river
<br>Winds somewhere safe to sea</em>
