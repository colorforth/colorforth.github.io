<h1>GreenArrays, Inc</h1><h3>

GreenArrays, Inc was founded to further the development of multi-computer chips. Our mission statement reads:<ul>
<li>To use our unique, proven design tools and a simple, green architecture to develop and market fine granularity, low-power solutions to problems difficult to solve using conventional technology</ul>

<p>Toward this end we have designed and are prototyping several chips:<ul>
<li><em><a href="GA32.htm">GA32</a></em> is a 32-computer chip in an 88-pin package
<li><a href="GA4.htm">GA4</a> is a 4-computer chip in an 8-pin package (2 mm sq)
<li>GA40 is a 40-computer chip fabricated at 130 nm</ul>
They were designed to optimize prototyping and minimize production costs.

<p>These chips boast technology that gives them unparalled versatility. They are small, fast, low-power and robust. And have a simple development environment based on colorForth. RAM, ROM, timing, wake-up, pads and serial, A/D and D/A ports are all unique.

<p>GreenArrays, Inc is a Nevada C corporation. Chuck Moore is currently the only shareholder. He is CTO, with other officers: Chet Brown as CEO, Dave Scarrino as CFO, Greg Bailey as VP Engineering and YP Cheng as VP of Strategic Solutions. We are aggressively seeking funding from VCs and private investors as well as partners in exploiting application niches. Currently we have no employees, but can draw upon 20 people with experience of multi-core chips. We plan liberal policies regarding samples, development boards and pricing.

<p>We chose the name GreenArrays to emphasize the low-power feature of this technology. The <a href="GA4.htm">GA4</a> uses a few milliwatts while running and a few microwatts asleep. It can be daisy-chained for distributed sense/control in a variety of applications. Such revolutionary technology requires a creative approach to applications. Our chips are software configurable to address a variety of problems. And are easy to further customize.
