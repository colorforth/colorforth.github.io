<h1>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
<br>Robert Frost</h1>

<h3><br clear="left">
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
<br>And sorry I could not travel both
<br>And be one traveler, long I stood
<br>And looked down one as far as I could
<br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
<br>And having perhaps the better claim,
<br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
<br>Though as for that the passing there
<br>Had worn them really about the same,

<p>And both that morning equally lay
<br>In leaves no step had trodden black.
<br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
<br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
<br>I doubted if I should ever come back.
            
<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:
<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --
<br><em>I took the one less traveled by,</em>
<br>And that has made all the difference.
