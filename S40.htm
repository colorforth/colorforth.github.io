This is the link to IntellaSys' spec sheet. IntellaSys is the division of TPL that managed the SEAForth project. The S40 chip was the ultimate product of that effort. I was chief designer and contributed 55% of the $40M, or so, that it cost.

<p>TPL laid off SEAForth employees in January 2009 and thus terminated the project. The status and future of S40 chips is unclear.

Papers suggesting ways to calibrate, linearize and improve precision of the S40 analog input and output.
