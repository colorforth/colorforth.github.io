<h1>Royalty Payments</h1><h3>
Given the amazing level of interest, I feel obliged to discuss the issue that prompted this posting. I didn't ask to become rich and don't like to whine about not being rich enough. But I won't be cheated.

<p>The situation is that Dan Leckrone (TPL) has refused to pay me the royalties specified in our contract. He is spending millions each month, of which I get zip. Unfortunately, the proceeds are paid to him and he exerts full control. I've argued with him for years, the last 9 months thru my lawyers.

<h2>Income</h2>
<p>The last payment I received was in July 2008. Since then he's boasted of another $1M in licenses. A review of my records indicates that I've received $11M over the last 5 years. I invested most of this money in residential real estate:<ul>
<li>My former residence in the Sierra, now my cabin
<li>A house in Central California for my son
<li>A marvelous house I'm building at Lake Tahoe</ul>
To do this, I relied on an income stream. My liquid reserves are almost exhausted and I'm pressed to fulfill my obligations. I'd like to keep spending and thus stimulate the economy. And I still need to support the SEAForth project.


<h2>Commercialization Agreement</h2>
Patriot Scientific and I own what is called the Moore Microprocessor Portfolio; a set of 7 US patents and 15 foreign versions. We each own 50%.

<p>My agreement with TPL is complicated. Basically, I hired him to license and enforce the MMP patents. He was to receive 45% of the proceeds; that is, 45% of my 50%. Leckrone made a deal (2" thick) with Patriot that included 15% off the top for expenses. 
<p>I agreed to a deduction of 11% for TPL's investors. And he agreed to fund 45% of the SEAForth chip development project. So my share is reduced from 55% to 49.5% and further reduced by 55% of SEAForth expenses. He terminated SEAForth in January 2009, so that deduction is gone.

<p>Leckrone has commingled funds in such a way the SEAForth expenses are hard to determine; perhaps $40M. They're mixed up with the expenses of other TPL projects. He has used this confusion to charge me arbitrary allocations for a plethora of expenses. This is the subject of an on-going audit.

<h2>Audit</h2>
My audit of TPL has documented MMP revenue of $260M. My 25% would be $65M. Deducting $25M for SEAForth expenses leaves $40M of which I've been paid $10M. So $30M is unaccounted for. I conclude that TPL owes me at least $20M of which he admits to $6M.

<p>These numbers will be refined and documented, but the conclusion will not change much. Massive unacknowledged debt.

<p>Leckrone can resolve this issue at any time by agreeing to what he owes me and arranging to pay it. Else a court will decide.

<p>Here are two graphs of my royalty stream. The first is actual royalties received thru 2008. The white bars show 8% of what TPL received, which amounts to $11M.<img src="actual.jpg" align="left">

<p clear="left">The second shows what the Agreement says I should have received, 60 days after TPL received it. White indicates 40%. What a rip-off.<img src="contract.jpg" align="left">
