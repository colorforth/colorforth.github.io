This is a fragment of a USGS composite of a Landsat photo draped over a  digital elevation dataset. Lighting is from the southeast. The image has South up, so that valleys and ridges do not appear reversed. Oriented as you drive south on Star Hill Rd.

<p>X marks our house. The red lines mark faults. San Andreas is 3 miles to northeast and San Gorgonio 5 miles to southwest. Stanford University is to the east, with the 2-mile Linear Accelerator establishing the scale and pointing at us. Bald Knob is to the northwest, across Kings Grove's Central Ridge. Star Hill Rd follows the ridge to the south. Durham ridge branches off to the west. Star Hill soon ends and the old stage route continues along Gordon Ridge to the coast north of San Gregorio.

<p>We are on the ridge separating the San Gregorio Creek watershed to the east from the Tunitas Creek watershed to the west.
